  Description:
    Abstract:
      This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most
      detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National
      Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing
      maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base
      and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely
      sensed and other information.

      This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and
      computerized attribute data. The map data are in a 7.5 minute
      quadrangle format and include a detailed, field verified inventory
      of soils and nonsoil areas that normally occur in a repeatable
      pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at
      the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line
      features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features
      too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large
      enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and
      management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the
      National Soil Information System relational database, which gives
      the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.
    Purpose:
      SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of
      soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO
      product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National
      Cooperative Soil Survey.
    Supplemental_Information:
      Digital versions of hydrography, cultural features, and other
      associated layers that are not part of the SSURGO data set may be
      available from the primary organization listed in the Point of
      Contact.

    This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool
    in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference
    source. This is public information and may be interpreted by
    organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on
    needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate

    Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps
    for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs.

    Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater
    than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation
    of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of
    contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The
    depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from
    them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and
    detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data
    and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only.
    Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      The attribute accuracy is tested by manual
      comparison of the source with hard copy plots and/or symbolized
      display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system.
      Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or
      on screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In
      addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid
      attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in
      the signed classification and correlation document and amendment(s).
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Certain node/geometry and topology GT-polygon/chain relationships
    are collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements
    (the GT-polygon corresponds to the soil delineation). Some of these
    requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains
    must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through
    nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain
    element and are consistent throughout, and the chains representing
    the limits of the file (neatline) are free of gaps. The tests of
    logical consistency are performed using vendor software. The
    neatline is generated by connecting the explicitly entered four
    corners of the digital file. All data outside the enclosed region
    are ignored and all data crossing these geographically straight
    lines are clipped at the neatline. Data within a specified tolerance
    of the neatline are snapped to the neatline. Neatline straightening
    aligns the digitized edges of the digital data with the generated
    neatline (i.e., with the longitude/latitude lines in geographic
    coordinates). All internal polygons are tested for closure with
    vendor software and are checked on hard copy plots. All data are
    checked for common soil lines (i.e., adjacent polygons with the
    same label). Quadrangles are edge matched within the soil survey
    area and edge locations generally do not deviate from centerline to
    centerline by more than 0.01 inch. The quadrangles in this soil survey
    are not edge matched to quadrangles in the following adjacent soil surveys
    due to age or conditions noted in the correlation document, published
    report, or other archived documentation.  The soil survey boundary is
    considered to be the soil boundary for the Gila Bend-Ajo Area, AZ, Parts
    of Maricopa and Pima Counties Soil Survey.
  Completeness_Report:
    A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named the same in
    terms of their soil and/or nonsoil areas. Each map unit differs
    in some respect from all others in a survey area and is uniquely
    identified. Each individual area is a delineation. Each map unit
    consists of one or more components.

    Soil scientists identify small areas of soils or miscellaneous
    (nonsoil) areas that have properties and behavior significantly
    different than the named soils in the surrounding map unit. These
    minor components may be indicated as special features. If they
    have a minimal effect on use and management, or could not be
    precisely located, they may not be indicated on the map.

    Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures
    were used in the classification of soils, design and name of map
    units, and location of special soil features. These standards are
    outlined in Agricultural Handbook 18, Soil Survey Manual, 1993,
    USDA, SCS; Agricultural Handbook 436, Soil Taxonomy, Soil Survey
    Staff, 1975, USDA, SCS; and all Amendments; Keys to Soil Taxonomy,
    Soil Survey Staff, (current issue); National Soil Survey
    Handbook, title 430-VI, (current issue).

    The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit
    delineations were based on data collected by scientists during
    the course of preparing the soil maps. Adherence to National
    Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on
    peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality
    control is outlined in the memorandum of understanding for the
    soil survey area and in documents that reside with the Natural
    Resources Conservation Service state soil scientist. Four kinds
    of map units are used in soil surveys: consociations, complexes,
    associations, and undifferentiated groups.

    Consociations - Consociations are named for the dominant soil. In
    a consociation, delineated areas are dominated by a single soil
    taxon and similar soils. At least one half of the pedons in each
    delineation are of the same soil component so similar to the
    named soil that major interpretations are not affected
    significantly. The total amount of dissimilar inclusions of
    other components in a map unit generally does not exceed about
    15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if nonlimiting. A single
    component of a dissimilar limiting inclusion generally does not
    exceed 10 percent if very contrasting.

    Complexes and associations - Complexes and associations are named
    for two or more dissimilar components with the dominant component
    listed first. They occur in a regularly repeating pattern. The major
    components of a complex cannot be mapped separately at a scale of
    about 1:24,000. The major components of an association can be
    separated at a scale of about 1:24,000. In each delineation of
    either a complex or an association, each major component is normally
    present, though their proportions may vary appreciably from one
    delineation to another. The total amount of inclusions in a map unit
    that are dissimilar to any of the major components does not exceed
    15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if nonlimiting. A single kind
    of dissimilar limiting inclusion usually does not exceed 10 percent.

    Undifferentiated groups - Undifferentiated groups consist of two
    or more components that do not always occur together in the same
    delineation, but are included in the same named map unit because
    use and management are the same or similar for common uses. Every
    delineation has at least one of the major components and some may
    have all of them. The same principles regarding proportion of
    inclusions apply to undifferentiated groups as to consociations.

    Minimum documentation consists of three complete soil profile
    descriptions that are collected for each soil added to the legend,
    one additional per 3,000 acres mapped; three 10 observation
    transects for each map unit, one additional 10 point transect per
    3,000 acres.

    A defined standard or level of confidence in the interpretive
    purity of the map unit delineations is attained by adjusting the
    kind and intensity of field investigations. Field investigations
    and data collection are carried out in sufficient detail to name
    map units and to identify accurately and consistently areas of
    about 40 acres.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their
        compilation to base maps that meet National Map Accuracy
        Standards. The difference in positional accuracy between the
        soil boundaries and special soil features locations in the
        field and their digitized map locations is unknown. The
        locational accuracy of soil delineations on the ground varies
        with the transition between map units.

        For example, on long gently sloping landscapes the transition
        occurs gradually over many feet. Where landscapes change
        abruptly from steep to level, the transition will be very
        narrow. Soil delineation boundaries and special soil features
        generally were digitized within 0.01 inch of their locations on
        the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched
        between data sets. The data along each quadrangle edge are
        matched against the data for the adjacent quadrangle. Edge
        locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline
        by more than 0.01 inch.

        Field mapping was transferred to 1:24,000 scale
        7.5 minute stable-base orthophotographs by NRCS soil scientists.
        The classification and map unit names were finalized at the final
        correlation in April, 1978.  The soil survey for Yuma-Wellton Area,
        Parts of Yuma County, Arizona, and Imperial County, California was
        published in 1980 at 1:24,000 scale.  An evaluation was made of the
        soil survey in 1999.  It was determined that the soil map units,
        delineations and map unit components were accurate.  The following
        additional map unit was added:

        The annotated overlays were raster scanned on
        a SCANGRAPHICS CF 500 Scanner at a resolution of 300 dpi.  The soil
        area features and special soil features were processed in LT4X
        Version 4.11.  The soil processing consisted of raster editing, map
        neat line development, labeling, edge matching and vector
        conversion.  The soil area features and special soil features were
        written to Digital Line Graph Optional format in LT4X.  Digitizing and
        quality control were done by the geographic information system
        specialist and cartographic technicians at the Temple, Texas Digitizing
        and Certification Center.

      Process_Description:
        The spatial data for the soil survey of Yuma-Wellton Area,
        Parts of Yuma County, Arizona and Imperial County, California
        was downloaded from the Soil Data Mart on October 15, 2012.
        The individual shapefiles were appended into a geodatabase for Region 8.
        The data were processed in ARCGIS 10.1 using a topology object with
        a 0.1 meter cluster tolerance for the purpose of eliminating gaps and
        overlaps within the region 8 soils geodatabase.  Individual soil
        survey area data were exported as shapefiles from the regional
        geodatabase.  A datum transformation from NAD83 to WGS84 using
        the NAD_1983_To_WGS_1984_1 datum transformation method was applied
        to the data.  The data were checked with the SSURGO Evaluation scripts
        provided by U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources
        Conservation Service. The shapefiles were then uploaded to the
        soil data warehouse for archival and distribution.

        The spatial data for the entire SSURGO database was recertified in October
        of 2019 to reduce storage requirements and to improve map display
        and geoprocessing performance.  The SSURGO data is internally managed
        using 12 Regional Transactional Spatial Databases (RTSD) that are in
        an ESRI File Geodatabase format.  The spatial extent of the RTSDs follow the
        Soil and Plant Science Division (SPSD) regional administrative boundaries.
        The XY coordinate system of this RTSD is USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area
        Conic USGS Version WKID: 102039 and has an XY storage precision of 0.001
        meters.  The RTSDs were recreated using a reduced storage precision of 0.1
        meters to reduce the physical size of the data.  The SSURGO data was also
        generalized by removing excess vertices, using a tolerance of 1 meter.
        The topology was validated at the CONUS level using a tolerance of 0.2
        meters.  This effort directly affects the gSSURGO and gNATSGO product since
        these deliverables are in a File Geodatabase format.

  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      Map Unit Delineations are closed polygons that may be dominated
      by a single soil or nonsoil component plus allowable similar or
      dissimilar soils, or they can be geographic mixtures of groups
      of soils or soils and nonsoil areas.

      The map unit symbol uniquely identifies each closed delineation
      map unit. Each symbol is linked to a map unit name. The map unit
      symbol is also the key for linking information in the National Soil
      Information System tables. The map unit symbols are not carried
      within the modified Digital Line Graph file; however, they are made
      available in a companion attribute file. The attribute file links
      the minor codes in the Digital Line Graph files to the map unit
      symbols.

      Map Unit Delineations are described by the National Soil
      Information System database. This attribute database gives the
      proportionate extent of the component soils and the properties for
      each soil. The database contains both estimated and measured data
      on the physical and chemical soil properties and soil
      interpretations for engineering, water management, recreation,
      agronomic, woodland, range, and wildlife uses of the soil.

      The National Soil Information System database contains static
      metadata. It documents the data structure and includes such
      information as what tables, columns, indexes, and relationships
      are defined as well as a variety of attributes of each of these
      database objects.  Attributes include table and column
      descriptions and detailed domain information.

      The National Soil Information System database also contains a
      distribution metadata. It records the criteria used for selecting
      map units and components for inclusion in the set of distributed
      data.
